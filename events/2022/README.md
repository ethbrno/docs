# ETHBrno² (2022)

## Manifesto

We believe that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right. And good privacy needs good security foundations. Therefore, the second edition of ETHBrno (ETHBrno²) will be mainly dedicated to these important topics ― **privacy & security**.

Our conference and hackathon is for all founders, developers, users and other people who are aware of the urgency of these topics. We are open to all blockchains and directions. We are Ethereum people, but we welcome creators and fans of all blockchains.

Let's learn together to defend against all threats, whether it's loss of privacy and state oppression, smart-contract exploits or simple phishing scams. Let's learn how to prevent these threats and how to analyse them retrospectively. Let's learn how to use the right tools, and if we don't have them, let's create them together.
