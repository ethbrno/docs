# Talks & workshops

We are mainly a hackathon, but in the presentation and education part we want to feature various interesting speakers from the privacy and security industry.

We would like to open up various topics and issues related to privacy and security (related to cryptocurrencies). We would like to raise awareness on these important topics through various lectures, panel discussions and workshops.
