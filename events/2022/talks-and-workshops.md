# Talks & workshops

In the conference part of our hackathon, we want to feature various interesting speakers from the privacy and security industry, both local and global.

We would like to open up various topics and issues related to privacy and security (related to cryptocurrencies). We would like to raise awareness on these important topics through various lectures, panel discussions and workshops.

The conference part will be divided into two parts:

* The English part, which will be part of the hackathon within the main venue
* A "local" part in Czech and Slovak language, which will take place partly in the main venue, but also in other locations

The first confirmed speakers will be announced during August.
