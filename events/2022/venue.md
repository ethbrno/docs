## Impact Hub Brno

* Adress: **Cyrilsk√° 7, Brno, 602 00** ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/wutjvk8jCFuDcvSG6), [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/339769163)) - web: [hubbrno.cz](https://www.hubbrno.cz/en/)
* Opening hours: **Fri Nov 11 13:00 - Sun Nov 13 20:00 (nonstop!)**

The main venue will be a modern coworking space called _Impact Hub_, just a few minutes walk from the city centre and the main train station. In less than 7 years of its existence, it has become an important part of Brno's freelancing community, inspiring and connecting many people. Great place for our hackathon, don't you think?

_Impact Hub_ will serve as the **main basecamp for the hackathon** and will be **available for hackers all day 24/7**.

You'll have everything you might need - different work areas (single or team, sitting or standing), fast internet, power sockets everywhere, meeting rooms, refreshments and much more. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible and we will do everything we can to make that happen.
