# Hackathon

Becoming a _hacker_ is the main way you can get a ticket and secure your participation in ETHBrnoÂ². We're expecting a few hundred hackers, and only dozens of tickets will go on general sale (if any at all).

You don't have to be a smart-contract developer or programmer to participate in our hackathon - you can be also a copywriter, economist, graphic designer, community builder, translator... Today's world of cryptocurrencies and Web3 is no longer just a nerd tech thing, but we need collaboration across professions to move forward.&#x20;

Our hackathon is open to all open minds who don't want to stand passively by, but want to put their own hands and heads to work in our _collective effort_. But, that doesn't mean you have to sit at your laptop and work all the time. The main thing is to enjoy the event - meet new interesting people or learn something new that will broaden your horizons.

This year's theme is **privacy and security** (read [our Manifesto](./#manifesto)).

## What to expect

We will do our best to make your experience as pleasant as possible:

* ðŸŒ± Pleasant and friendly environment full of enthusiastic people
* :speech\_balloon: Dozens of experienced mentors who will be happy to help you with your project
* :salad: Food and drinks for all participants (for free)
* â›º Meeting rooms, for team private meetings etc. (reservation required)
* :electric\_plug: Ultra fast internet connection and power sockets everywhere
