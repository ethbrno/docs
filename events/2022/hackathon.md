# Hackathon

Becoming a _hacker_ is the main way you can get a ticket (for free!) and secure your participation in ETHBrno². We're expecting a few hundred hackers, and only dozens of tickets will go on general sale.

You don't have to be a smart-contract developer or programmer to participate in our hackathon - you can be also a copywriter, economist, graphic designer, community builder, translator... Today's world of Web3 and cryptocurrencies is no longer just a nerd tech thing, but we need collaboration across professions to move forward.&#x20;

Our hackathon is open to all open minds who don't want to stand passively by, but want to put their own hands and heads to work. But, that doesn't mean you have to sit at your laptop and work all the time. The main thing is to enjoy the event, meet new people, learn something new and _be part of our collective effort_.

This year's theme is **privacy and security** (read [our Manifesto](./#manifesto)).
