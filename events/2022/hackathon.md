# Hackathon

{% hint style="success" %}
Register here  üëâ  [join.ethbrno.cz](https://join.ethbrno.cz/)
{% endhint %}

Becoming an _active participant_ is the only way you can get a ticket and secure your participation in ETHBrno¬≤. We're expecting a few hundred hackers (or volunteers, speakers, mentors, judges) and we won't be selling any tickets.

You don't have to be a smart-contract developer or programmer to participate in our hackathon - you can be also a copywriter, economist, graphic designer, community builder, translator... Today's world of cryptocurrencies and Web3 is no longer just a nerd tech thing, but we need collaboration across professions to move forward.&#x20;

Our hackathon is open to all open minds who don't want to stand passively by, but want to put their own hands and heads to work in our _collective effort_. But, that doesn't mean you have to sit at your laptop and work all the time. The main thing is to enjoy the event - meet new interesting people or learn something new that will broaden your horizons.

This year's theme is **privacy and security** (read [our Manifesto](./#manifesto)).

## What to expect

We will do our best to make your experience as pleasant as possible:

* üå± Pleasant and friendly environment full of enthusiastic people
* :speech\_balloon: Dozens of experienced mentors who will be happy to help you with your project
* üìö Lots of [talks and workshops](talks-and-workshops.md) where you can learn about current trends
* :salad: Food and drinks for all participants (for free of course!)
* ‚õ∫ Meeting rooms, for team private meetings etc. (reservation required)
* üîå Ultra fast internet connection and power sockets everywhere
* üëï Swag bag with ETHBrno t-shirt and sponsors' items for each participant
* üç∏ Various interesting side-events and parties
* ‚ùì You can only love or hate Brno, together we will find out why
* ‚ú® And much more...

## Hackathon features

### Unified application form

Some participants want to have multiple roles at the same time and filling out multiple forms is a hassle. So we thought why not have one single form!&#x20;

All [participants roles](hackathon.md#the-participants-roles) (hacker, volunteer, mentor, speaker, judge) can now apply for the hackathon using a single application form - [join.ethbrno.cz](https://join.ethbrno.cz)

### Quadratic funding/voting

Similar to ETHBerlin¬≥, we will use quadratic voting for the main prize pool. We will build on this idea and try to make more use of quadratic voting.

For expert tracks we are thinking about using a quadratic funding system, where each project would be rewarded according to the votes of the judges.

## The participants' roles

Each participant has an active role in the hackathon, this year we have 5 roles:

* **Hacker**
* **Volunteer**
* **Mentor**
* **Speaker**
* **Judge**

You can apply for any role (and even more roles at the same time) in the application form, but you must justify your choice to us.
