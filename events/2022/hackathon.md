# Hackathon

{% hint style="info" %}
The application form for the hackathon will be published during August.
{% endhint %}

Our hackathon is open to all open minds who don't want to stand passively by, but want to put their own hands and heads to work.

You don't have to be a smart-contract developer or programmer - you can be also a copywriter, economist, graphic designer, community builder, translator... Today's world of Web3 and cryptocurrencies is no longer just a nerd tech thing, but we need collaboration across professions to move forward.

This year's theme is **privacy and security** (read [our Manifesto](./#manifesto)).

## Examples of hacks

Here are some examples of what you can start building:

* A privacy- or security-enhancing tool of any kind
* Blockchain or smart-contract analysis tool
* Marketing campaign to promote privacy and security
* Practical demonstration of the use of Zero-knowledge proofs
* Identification of risks associated with Layer2s

## Rules

* Maximum of 5 people per team
* Projects must be related to "Privacy & Security" topic
* All code for projects must be written during the event
* You cannot steal another team’s source code
* The decision of judges is final in terms of determining prizes and awards
* Teams may have members joining remotely
* Teams that have members joining remotely must have a member present on the venue for the judging
