# FAQ

### When will the event be held and for how long?

The event will take place on **November 11-13, 2022**.

### Where will the event take place?

The main venue is **Impact Hub Brno**, but it will not be the only venue. For more informations see [Venues](venues.md).

### How do I get a ticket or ensure my attendance?

There are several different ways:

* ****[**sign up for the hackathon as a hacker**](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/JFQ+WOryuHqPJAna0BOoLka3Lh+JPGrPSm4SWWFYYx0/) (free)&#x20;

### How many visitors will the event be sized for?

For [the hackathon](hackathon.md) we expect something between 200 and 400 hackers and dozens of visitors with regular tickets.&#x20;

For [side-events](side-events.md) (which will be also in Czech or Slovak language) we expect hundreds more visitors from the general public. We plan to involve other venues as well.

### Is this an Ethereum-only event? Does my project have to be Ethereum based?

No, this is not an Ethereum-only event. The hackathon is organized by the Czech Ethereum community ([gwei.cz](https://gwei.cz)), but anyone can participate (and give a talk) as long as their topic is security and privacy. The same applies to the projects in the hackathon.

### I can't attend in person - will the talks be livestreamed?

Yes, we plan to livestream all talks for free. Links will be posted later.
