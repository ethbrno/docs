# FAQ

### When will the event be held and for how long?

The event will take place in the second half of October. We are working on the final dates. The event will not be just a one-day event, but we expect at least Friday and Saturday. We are also considering extending it to Thursday and Sunday.

### Where will the event take place?

We are in the process of selecting the most suitable venue for the main venue, which will be announced during August.

We would like to offer other venues in addition to the main venue. These may host additional lectures and workshops for the general public (local audience).

### How do I get a ticket or ensure my attendance?

There are several different ways:

* **sign up for the** [**hackathon**](hackathon.md) **as a hacker** (free) - _applications will open during August_
* **buy a general admission ticket**: only a limited number will be available (paid) - _sales will start during August_
* **apply as** [**volunteer**](organizing-team.md#volunteers) **** (free): contact [tereza@utxo.foundation](mailto:tereza@utxo.foundation)
* **apply as a** [**speaker**](talks-and-workshops.md) **** (free): contact [tree@utxo.foundation](mailto:tree@utxo.foundation)
* **apply as a** [**sponsor**](sponsors.md) **** (paid): contact [tereza@utxo.foundation](mailto:tereza@utxo.foundation)

### How many visitors will the event be sized for?

In the English part we expect something between 200 and 400 hackers and dozens of visitors with regular tickets.&#x20;

In the local part (which will be in Czech or Slovak language) we expect hundreds more visitors from the general public. We plan to involve other venues as well.

### Is this an Ethereum-only event? Does my project have to be Ethereum based?

No, this is not an Ethereum-only event. The hackathon is organized by the Czech Ethereum community, but anyone can participate (and give a talk) as long as their topic is security and privacy. The same applies to the projects in the hackathon.

### I can't attend in person - will the talks be livestreamed?

Yes, we plan to livestream all talks for free. Links will be posted later.
