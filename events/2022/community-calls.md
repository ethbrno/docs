# Community calls

The main event and its focus will be introduced on the weekly "Community calls" on Twitter Spaces.  &#x20;

Every Community call will be focused on a topic relevant to the theme of the main event and on each we will introduce one of the speakers or mentors. We aim to keep calls within one hour.&#x20;

Suggested schedule of the event:

* Welcome & speaker introduction <15 minutes
* &#x20;Topic introduction and speaker presentation < 20 minutes
* Q\&A < 15 minutes

An open form for questions will be introduced in advance for every event. Everyone who attends the event will be eligible to receive a POAP. Events will be announced on Twitter, Zitrone and public Discord channels.
