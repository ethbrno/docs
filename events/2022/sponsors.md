# Sponsors

We are looking for sponsors and partners who share our vision and who can add further value to our event. Unfortunately, privacy and security will never be a completely mainstream topic, so support from projects that recognize the importance of our topics is essential.

We are an independent and transparent hackathon, for legal informations see [Impressum](impressum.md).
