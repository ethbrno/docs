# Speakers

In the conference part of our hackathon, we want to feature various interesting speakers from the privacy and security industry, both local and global.

We would like to open up various topics and issues related to privacy and security (related to cryptocurrencies). We would like to raise awareness on these important topics through various lectures, panel discussions and workshops.
