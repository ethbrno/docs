# Hackathon features

### Unified application form

Some participants want to have multiple roles at the same time and filling out multiple forms is a hassle. So we thought why not have one single form!&#x20;

All [participants roles](hackathon-features.md#the-participants-roles) (hacker, volunteer, mentor, speaker, judge) can now apply for the hackathon using a single application form - [join.ethbrno.cz](https://join.ethbrno.cz)

### Using Dework.xyz

[Dework](https://dework.ethbrno.cz/) is web3-native project management. We use it for the following:

* Organization:
  * [Community Issues](https://app.dework.xyz/ethbrno/community-space) - Community tasks
  * [Community Suggestions](https://app.dework.xyz/ethbrno/suggestions) - Your ideas to improve our hackathon
  * Task management for core & production team and volunteers
* Hackathon:
  * [Ideas Shop](https://app.dework.xyz/ethbrno/ideas-shop/view/board-l8awhuan) - Ideas for projects that you can improve or implement as part of the hackathon
  * [Find a team](https://app.dework.xyz/ethbrno/eb-or-find-a-team-44886) - A ticket system to help find hackers for a team, or find a team for hackers
  * [Sponsor bounties](https://app.dework.xyz/ethbrno/eb-or-sponsor-bounti/view/board-l8c0oe13) - Extra rewards from sponsors for completing special tasks

### Quadratic funding/voting

Similar to [ETHBerlin³,](https://vote.ethberlin.ooo/) we will use quadratic voting for the main prize pool. We will build on this idea and try to make more use of quadratic voting.

For expert tracks we are thinking about using a quadratic funding system, where each project would be rewarded according to the votes of the judges.
