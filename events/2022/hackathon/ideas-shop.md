## List of ideas

<summary>Security-focused catalog of crypto wallets</summary>

As recent hacks [have shown](https://twitter.com/0xTre/status/1554916547940196352), the wrong choice of wallet can put its users at great risk. Following the example of bitcoin site [Wallet Scrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/), it would be a good idea to make a list of wallets, their features and most importantly - their security.
