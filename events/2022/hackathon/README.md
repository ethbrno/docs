# Hackathon

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Becoming an _active participant_ is the only way you can get a ticket and secure your participation in ETHBrno¬≤. We're expecting a few hundred hackers (or volunteers, speakers, mentors, judges) and we won't be selling any tickets.

You don't have to be a smart-contract developer or programmer to participate in our hackathon - you can be also a copywriter, economist, graphic designer, community builder, translator... Today's world of cryptocurrencies and Web3 is no longer just a nerd tech thing, but we need collaboration across professions to move forward.&#x20;

Our hackathon is open to all open minds who don't want to stand passively by, but want to put their own hands and heads to work in our _collective effort_. But, that doesn't mean you have to sit at your laptop and work all the time. The main thing is to enjoy the event - meet new interesting people or learn something new that will broaden your horizons.

This year's theme is **privacy and security** (read [our Manifesto](../#manifesto)).

## What to expect

We will do our best to make your experience as pleasant as possible:

* üå± Pleasant and friendly environment full of enthusiastic people
* :speech\_balloon: Dozens of experienced mentors who will be happy to help you with your project
* üìö Lots of [talks and workshops](../talks-and-workshops.md) where you can learn about current trends
* :salad: Food and drinks for all participants (for free of course!)
* ‚õ∫ Meeting rooms, for team private meetings etc. (reservation required)
* üîå Ultra fast internet connection and power sockets everywhere
* üëï Swag bag with ETHBrno t-shirt and sponsors' items for each participant
* üç∏ Various interesting side-events and parties
* ‚ùì You can only love or hate Brno, together we will find out why
* ‚ú® And much more...

## The participants' roles

* **Hacker**
* **Volunteer**
* **Mentor**
