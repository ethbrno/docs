# ETHBrno² Česky

We want to complement [the hackathon](hackathon.md) in the main venue with another smaller venue(s) that would host lectures, workshops and panel discussions for the general public and newcomers, primarily in the local language (Czech/Slovak).

ETHBrno² Česky will take place over the weekend (Saturday-Sunday).

Anyone with an ETHBrno wristband will have free entry (reservation required), others will be able to purchase a ticket.
