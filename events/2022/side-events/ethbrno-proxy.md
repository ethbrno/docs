# ETHBrno Proxy

A sub-conference for a local general audience.

We want to complement [the hackathon](../hackathon.md) with additional lectures, workshops and panel discussions for the general public and newcomers, primarily in the local language (Czech/Slovak). The topics to be presented should be in line with [our manifesto](../#manifesto).

Event will take place over the weekend (Saturday-Sunday).

Anyone with an ETHBrno wristband will have free entry (reservation required), others will be able to purchase a ticket.

We will create a special microsite for this event, which will be internationalized - in Czech and English.
