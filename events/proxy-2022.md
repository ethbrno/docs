# ETHBrno Proxy 2022

{% hint style="info" %}
Tickets for ETHBrno Proxy will be available in early October.
{% endhint %}

A sub-conference for a local general audience, which will be held in parallel with [ETHBrno²](2022/) hackathon.

We want to complement [the hackathon](2022/hackathon.md) with additional lectures, workshops and panel discussions for the general public and newcomers, primarily in the local language (Czech/Slovak). The topics to be presented should be in line with [our manifesto](2022/#manifesto).

Event will take place over the weekend (Saturday-Sunday).

Anyone with an ETHBrno wristband will have free entry (reservation required), others will be able to purchase a ticket.

We will create a special microsite for this event, which will be internationalized - in Czech and English.
